TODO

Add compression algorithm to flask with nginx gzip. Shouldn't need to do any decompression --
Added proxy using Nginx in front of flask --
Bundled JS files using webpack and node --

finish the Rust API and data expansion
add logging
Update readme


parse uploads
fix footer loading in

# Would be nice
Use same API function to query battles for both upload and user query (would need to search either by ID or name/server)
brotli compression in nginx, would likely need separate docker image to build

filter function ideas:

complete() -> filters out turns === 0 games
[p1,p2].equipment("hero", set) -> filters battles where hero in picks and equipment in the set

new fields

turns -> int
seconds -> int
