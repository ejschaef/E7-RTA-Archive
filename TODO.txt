TODO

Add compression algorithm to flask with nginx gzip. Shouldn't need to do any decompression --
Added proxy using Nginx in front of flask --
Bundled JS files using webpack and node --

finish the Rust API and data expansion
add logging
Update readme

# Would be nice
Use same API function to query battles for both upload and user query (would need to search either by ID or name/server)
brotli compression in nginx, would likely need separate docker image to build
