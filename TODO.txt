TODO:

logout button --
upload files --
data table for battles --
KPIs for loss and win streaks
filtering battles -- (finished initial implementation of defining filters)
apply filters
loading screen --
make variables like hero manager retrievable with redis --
season kpi --
compression for csv files (no longer uploading files)

content manager is inefficient; each variable should be stored separately rather than as one object so that they don't need to be deserialized to be accessed

switch reference session variables (heroes, users, and seasons, etc) to chron job -- (finished for Heroes and Season details)
switch user manager to DB backend --

BUGS:

plotly line doubles when undocking window and making smaller -> switch to chartsJS -- (not switching, but fixed issue)

app does not handle case when user filters battles and none remain
